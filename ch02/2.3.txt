1. What are the minimum number of addressing modes needed for computation?
	- register indirect addressing is the only mode that is strictly required.
	- it will allow you to calculate any address you want in a register, and use it to do the access.

2. Why include addressing modes that arenâ€™t strictly needed?
	- They are convenient!
	- They save registers.

3. Research and then describe how pipelining (or one of the other complicating factors) affects the fetch-execute cycle.
