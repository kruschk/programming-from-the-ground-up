I think the length count is the best method; it's intuitive, it's easy to work with, and it helps combat some nasty attacks on a machine.
A null-terminating character is probably the worst option, since you have to search the whole array to find the end. Also, it opens up the machine to some nasty attacks. Unfortunately, this is the method C uses (and C is my favourite!).
If I knew the address was sorted, I would probably choose the ending address method. That way, since I know that it's sorted, I can access the greatest/least value by directly accessing the first/last memory address. Simple!
