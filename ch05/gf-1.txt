What difference does the size of the buffer make?
	- System calls incur a lot of overhead, so we want to make as few as
	  possible in our programs.
		- e.g. reading from/writing to disk is a VERY slow process
	- Buffers allow us to make much fewer system calls by storing the data
	  temporarily. Having the data at our fingertips (in RAM) is MUCH
	  faster than repeated syscalls.
		- For example, we make a read() system call and read it into a
		  buffer, if the buffer is large enough, no more system calls
		  are needed.
	- In general, we want to make our buffers large enough that we don't
	  need to make repeated system calls, but not so large that they take
	  up space in memory for no reason.
