Research garbage collection. What advantages and disadvantages does this have
over the style of memory management used here?
	- As usual, Wikipedia has a good article on garbage collection (GC):
		- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)
	- Pros:
		- Automatic memory management means that memory management
		  requires no attention from the programmer whatsoever.
		- It eliminates lots of bugs associated with memory
		  management:
			- dangling pointer bugs (freeing memory when there are
			  still pointers to it)
			- double free bugs (freeing a memory location more
			  than once)
			- certain kinds of memory leaks (deleting all
			  references to an object without freeing the
			  associated memory so that memory usage bloats)
	- Cons:
		- Significant overhead
		- GC does not in general provide real-time behaviour. That is,
		  poorly optimized can incur seemingly random pauses in
		  program execution while GC does its thing.
