# PURPOSE:	Program to manage memory usage - allocates and deallocates
#		memory as requested.
#
# NOTES:	The programs using these routines will ask for a certain size
#		of memory. We actually use more than that size, but we put it
#		at the beginning, before the pointer we hand back. We add a
#		size field and an AVAILABLE/UNAVAILABLE marker. So, the memory
#		looks like this:
# ###############################################################
# # Available marker | size of memory | actual memory locations #
# ###############################################################
#                                       ^--returned pointer points here
#		The pointer we return only points to the actual locations
#		requested to make it easier for the calling program. It also
#		allows us to change out structure without the calling program
#		having to change at all.

### FUNCTIONS ###
## allocate_init ##
# PURPOSE:	call this function to initialize the functions (specifically,
#		this sets heap_begin and current_break). This has no parameters
#		and no return value.
#

.globl allocate_init
.type allocate_init, @function

allocate_init:
	pushq	%rbp	# standard function stuff
	movq	%rsp, %rbp

	# if the brk system call is called with 0 in %rbx, it returns the last
	# valid usable address.
	movq	$SYS_BRK, %rax	# find out where the break is
	movq	$0, %rdi
	syscall

	incq	%rax	# %rax now has the last valid address, and we want the
			# memory location after that

	movq	%rax, current_break	# store the current break

	movq	%rax, heap_begin	# store the current break as our first
					# address. This will cause the allocate
					# function to get more memory from
					# linux the first time it is run.

	movq	%rbp, %rsp
	popq	%rbp
	ret
## end of function ##

## allocate ##
# PURPOSE:	This function is used to grab a section of memory. It checks to
#		see if there are any free blocks, and if not, it asks Linux for
#		a new one.
#
# PARAMETERS:	This function has one parameter - the size of the memory block
#		we want to allocate.
#
# RETURN VALUE:	This function returns the address of the allocated memory in
#		%rax. If there is no memory available, it will return 0 in
#		%rax.
#
# VARIABES:	%rcx - hold the size of the requested memory (first/only
#		       parameter)
#		%rax - current memory region being examined
#		%rbx - current break position
#		%rdx - size of current memory region
#
# PROCESSING:	We scan through each memory region starting with heap_begin.
#		We look at the size of each one, and if it has been allocated.
#		If it's big enough for the requested size, and it's available,
#		it grabs that one. If it does not find a region large enough,
#		it asks Linux for more memory. In that case, it moves
#		current_break up.

## deallocate ##
# PURPOSE:	The purpose of this function is to give back a region of
#		memory to the pool after we're done using it.
#
#
# PARAMETERS:	The only parameter is the address of the memory we want to
#		return to the memory pool.
#
# RETURN VALUE:	There is no return value.
#
# PROCESSING:	If you remember, we actually hand the program the start of the
#		memory that they can use, which is 16 storage locations after
#		the start of the memory region. All we have to do is go back
#		16 locations and mark that memory as available, so the allocate
#		function knows it can use it.
