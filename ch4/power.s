# PURPOSE:	Program to illustrate how functions work.
#		This program will compute the value of
#		2^3 + 5^2
#

# Everything in the main program is stored in registers, so the data
# section doesn't have anything.

	pushq	$3		# push second argument
	pushq	$2		# push the first argument
	call	power		# call the function
	addq	$16, %rsp	# move the stack pointer back
	pushq	%rax		# save the first answer before
				# calling the next function

	pushq	$5		# push first argument
	call	power		# call the function
	addq	$16, %rsp	# move the stack pointer back

				# saved the first answer onto the stack, so
				# now we can just pop it out into %ebx.

# PURPOSE:	This function is used to compute the value of a number
#		raised to a power.
#
# INPUT:	First argument - the base number
#		Second argument - the power to raise it to
#
# OUTPUT:	Will give the result as a return value
#
# NOTES:	The power must be 1 or greater
#
# VARIABLES:	%ebx - holds the base number
#		%ecx - holds the power
#		-4(%ebp) - holds the current result
#
#		%eax is used for temporary storage
#
